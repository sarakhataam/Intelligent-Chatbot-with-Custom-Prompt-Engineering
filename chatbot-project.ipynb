Make sure to stay hydrated and rest. If your headache persists, consider reaching out to a healthcare provider for advice.\n\nUser: I have been feeling fatigued for the past week and experiencing shortness of breath.\nAssistant: I'm sorry to hear that you've been feeling this way. Fatigue and shortness of breath can have a variety of causes, from lack of rest or stress to health conditions that may need attention. It could be helpful to ensure you're getting enough rest, staying hydrated, and managing stress. However, if these symptoms continue, it’s best to reach out to a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\n\nUser: What are the possible causes of lower back pain?\nAssistant: Lower back pain is a common issue and can arise from muscle strain, poor posture, or even extended periods of sitting. Sometimes, conditions like herniated discs or arthritis can also be factors. Trying gentle stretches, maintaining good posture, and avoiding heavy lifting may help ease the pain. If the pain is persistent, consider consulting a doctor for a more thorough examination.\n\nUser: What does abutment of the nerve root mean? What treatment is required for annular bulging and tear?\nAssistant: Abutment of the nerve root generally refers to when a structure, like a disc, is pressing close to a nerve, which can sometimes cause pain or discomfort. Annular bulging and tears can also contribute to similar symptoms. Treatments may vary depending on the severity, but they can include physical therapy, medications, or in some cases, surgical options. Consulting with a specialist would be ideal to understand the best course of action based on your specific situation.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n# Define a custom prompt template for each user message\ndef create_custom_prompt(input_text, persona, one_shot_example, previous_context=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a structured prompt based on input, including persona, one-shot example, and chat history.\n    \"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"{persona}\\n{one_shot_example}\\n\"\n    \n    # Add previous context if available\n    if previous_context:\n        prompt += previous_context + \"\\n\"\n\n    # Add the current user input to the prompt\n    prompt += f\"User: {input_text}\\nAssistant:\"\n    return prompt\n\ndef get_chatbot_response(input_text):\n    \"\"\"Generates a response based on user input, structured prompting, and one-shot example.\"\"\"\n    global chat_history_ids\n\n    # First, check for a scripted response to simple phrases\n    scripted_response = generate_scripted_response(input_text)\n    if scripted_response:\n        return scripted_response\n\n    # Create the custom prompt with persona, one-shot example, and chat history\n    previous_context = tokenizer.decode(chat_history_ids) if chat_history_ids.shape[0] > 0 else \"\"\n    prompt_text = create_custom_prompt(input_text, assistant_persona, one_shot_example, previous_context)\n    \n    # Encode the prompt and move to the same device as the model\n    new_user_input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt_text + tokenizer.eos_token, return_tensors='pt').to(device)\n\n    # Append new user input to chat history\n    if chat_history_ids.shape[0] == 0:\n        chat_history_ids = new_user_input_ids\n    else:\n        chat_history_ids = torch.cat([chat_history_ids, new_user_input_ids], dim=-1).to(device)\n\n    # Generate model response with tuned parameters\n    response_ids = model.generate(\n        chat_history_ids,\n        max_length=chat_history_ids.shape[-1] + 100,\n        pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,\n        temperature=0.7,\n        top_p=0.9,\n        repetition_penalty=1.15\n    )\n\n    # Decode the model response, skip past user input in history\n    bot_response = tokenizer.decode(response_ids[:, chat_history_ids.shape[-1]:][0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n    \n    # Update chat history with model response\n    chat_history_ids = torch.cat([chat_history_ids, response_ids[:, chat_history_ids.shape[-1]:]], dim=-1)\n    \n    return bot_response\n\n# Example usage\nprint(\"Welcome to the Health Chatbot!
